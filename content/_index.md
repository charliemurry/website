## Current and Recent Research

[**Optimal Estimation of Discrete Choice Demand Models with Consumer and Product Data**](http://joris.pinkse.org/publication/grumps/grumps.pdf) (January 2024)
(with Paul Grieco, Joris Pinkse, Stephan Sagl)  
Revisions requested from *Econometrica*  
[NBER Working Paper w33397](https://www.nber.org/papers/w33397)  
[Julia Package](https://nittanylion.github.io/Grumps.jl/dev/) documentation, or ```Pkg.add("Grumps")``` in Julia  
*Previous Version:* [Conformant and Efficient Estimation of Discrete Choice Demand Models](/working_papers/like-blp.pdf) (May 2023)  
<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>

- We propose a likelihood based estimator for BLP-style demand models that natively incorporates multiple sources of data:  "micro" data from individual purchases and aggregate data on shares and prices. We introduce a property of our estiamtor called *conformance:* the estimator's rate of convergence will be the fastest possible given the variation available in the data. For example, the researcher can leverage both variation in choice probabilities through the likelihood and variation in product level restrictions to identify random coefficients, without pretesting.

[**Bundling Demand in K-12 Broadband Procurement**](/working_papers/bundling_Feb25.pdf)  
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07277)  
(with Gaurab Aryal, Arnab Palit, and Pallavi Pal)  
Accepted in the non-publication track at **EC'24**  

<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>

- Geographically bundling schools in broadband procurement had a large effect on prices and bandwidth. We show that these outcomes were due to an exposure problem in broadband procurement. The bundling program saved schools at least as much as current broadband subsidies, and revealed preference of the schools indicates large welfare gains due to the bundling program.

[**The Evolution of Market Power in the US Automobile Industry**](/working_papers/CarMarkupsJuly2023.pdf) (July 2023)    
(with Paul Grieco and Ali Yurukoglu)  
*The Quarterly Journal of Economics,* Volume 139, Issue 2, May 2024, Pages 1201–1253.  
[Replication Package](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CZGOKP)
<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>

- We estimate a decrease in markups and a rise in consumer surplus in the US automobile market from 1980--2018. Production efficiencies and rising product quality are the main sources for the increase in consumer surplus, not changes in market concentration or changing preferences.

[**Price Discrimination in International Airline Markets**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05751)  
(with Gaurab Aryal and Jonathan W. Williams)  
*Review of Economic Studies* Volume 91, Issue 2, March 2024, Pages 641–689.   
[replicaiton package](https://zenodo.org/record/7392123)
<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>

- We develop and estimate a model of dynamic pricing and price discrimination of a monopolist airline to quantify how consumers and firms split surplus. 
- Airlines achieve 77% of 1st-best welfare and most of the gap is due to private information by passengers, not airline uncertainty about future arriving passengers.

[Inventory Management in Decentralized Markets](/working_papers/inventory_march2023.pdf) (March 2023)  
(with Fei Li, Can Tan, and Yiyi Zhou)  
*International Economic Review* Volume 65, Issue 1, February 2024, Pages 431-470.  
<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>

- We present a model of an intermediary that faces search frictions in both the "retail" and "wholesale" market. In equilibrium, intermediaries hold and manage inventory.  
- We quantify the model and find that incentives for inventory management in the used car market come from search frictions, not inventory holding costs.

<!-- [Price Discrimination and Product Variety: the Case of Implantable Medical Devices](./)
(with Kritika Goel, Michael Grubb, and Julie Mortimer)
- Direct price discrimination promotes efficiencies in manufacturers' product line decisions. Fewer products are introduced when manufacturers can price discriminate.  
- We show this in the context of medical devices, where price discrimination allows smaller hospitals to purchase MRI-compatible heart devices for lower prices.  -->
