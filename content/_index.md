## Current Research

[Conformant and Efficient Estimation of Discrete Choice Demand Models](http://personal.psu.edu/plg15/files/preprint/like-blp.pdf) (May 2023, submitted)  
(with Paul Grieco, Joris Pinkse, Stephan Sagl) 
- We propose a likelihood based estimator for BLP-style models that natively incorporates multiple sources of data --  "micro" data from individual purchases and aggregate data on shares and prices.  
- There is a companion Julia package, [GruMPS](https://nittanylion.github.io/Grumps.jl/stable/), that implements our method.  
<br>
```Pkg.add("Grumps")``` in Julia.

[The Evolution of Market Power in the US Automobile Industry](/working_papers/CarMarkupsMarch2023.pdf) (March 2023)    
(with Paul Grieco and Ali Yurukoglu)  
Revision requested from *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*
- We estimate a decrease in markups and a rise in consumer surplus in the US automobile market from 1980--2018. Production efficiencies and rising product quality are the main sources for the increase in consumer surplus, not changes in market concentration or changing preferences. 

[Price Discrimination in International Airline Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05751)  
(with Gaurab Aryal and Jonathan W. Williams)  
forthcoming at *Review of Economic Studies*  
- We develop and estimate a model of dynamic pricing and price discrimination of a monopolist airline to quantify how consumers and firms split surplus. 
- Airlines achieve 77% of 1st-best welfare and most of the gap is due to private information by passengers, not airline uncertainty about future arriving passengers. 

[Inventory Management in Decentralized Markets](/working_papers/inventory_march2023.pdf) (March 2023)  
(with Fei Li, Can Tan, and Yiyi Zhou)  
Revision requested at *International Economic Review*  

<!-- [Price Discrimination and Product Variety: the Case of Implantable Medical Devices](./)
(with Kritika Goel, Michael Grubb, and Julie Mortimer)
- Direct price discrimination promotes efficiencies in manufacturers' product line decisions. Fewer products are introduced when manufacturers can price discriminate.  
- We show this in the context of medical devices, where price discrimination allows smaller hospitals to purchase MRI-compatible heart devices for lower prices.  -->

<!-- [Overcoming the exposure problem: The case of K-12 broadband procurement(./)]
(with Gaurab Aryal, Pallavi Pal, and Arnab Palit) -->
