## Current Research

[Conformant and Efficient Estimation of Discrete Choice Demand Models](https://paulgrieco.github.io/files/preprint/like-blp.pdf) (May 2023)  
(with Paul Grieco, Joris Pinkse, Stephan Sagl)  
Revisions requested from *Econometrica*  
- We propose a likelihood based estimator for BLP-style demand models that natively incorporates multiple sources of data:  "micro" data from individual purchases and aggregate data on shares and prices.  
- There is a companion Julia package, [GruMPS](https://nittanylion.github.io/Grumps.jl/stable/), that implements our method.  
<br>
```Pkg.add("Grumps")``` in Julia.

[The Evolution of Market Power in the US Automobile Industry](/working_papers/CarMarkupsJuly2023.pdf) (July 2023)    
(with Paul Grieco and Ali Yurukoglu)  
Accepted for publication at *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*
<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>

- We estimate a decrease in markups and a rise in consumer surplus in the US automobile market from 1980--2018. Production efficiencies and rising product quality are the main sources for the increase in consumer surplus, not changes in market concentration or changing preferences.

[Price Discrimination in International Airline Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05751)  
(with Gaurab Aryal and Jonathan W. Williams)  
forthcoming at *Review of Economic Studies*  
[replicaiton package](https://zenodo.org/record/7392123)
<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>

- We develop and estimate a model of dynamic pricing and price discrimination of a monopolist airline to quantify how consumers and firms split surplus. 
- Airlines achieve 77% of 1st-best welfare and most of the gap is due to private information by passengers, not airline uncertainty about future arriving passengers.

[Inventory Management in Decentralized Markets](/working_papers/inventory_march2023.pdf) (March 2023)  
(with Fei Li, Can Tan, and Yiyi Zhou)  
Accepted at *International Economic Review* 
<details>
<summary>Summary</summary>

- We present a model of an intermediary that faces search frictions in both the "retail" and "wholesale" market. In equilibrium, intermediaries hold and manage inventory.  
- We quantify the model and find that incentives for inventory management in the used car market come from search frictions, not inventory holding costs.

<!-- [Price Discrimination and Product Variety: the Case of Implantable Medical Devices](./)
(with Kritika Goel, Michael Grubb, and Julie Mortimer)
- Direct price discrimination promotes efficiencies in manufacturers' product line decisions. Fewer products are introduced when manufacturers can price discriminate.  
- We show this in the context of medical devices, where price discrimination allows smaller hospitals to purchase MRI-compatible heart devices for lower prices.  -->
